# Vortex tracker in NCL

Development version of a cyclone tracker using NCL to read and track variables. 

Files in /lib/ can be used as a stand alone tracker or to relocate ibtracs data. 

/lib/get_???_variables.ncl need to be edited to accomodate the file structure you have. load the relevant file at the top of the tracking script.
